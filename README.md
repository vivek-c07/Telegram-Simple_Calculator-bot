# Telegram-Simple_Calculator-bot
A simple calculator Bot that can be accessed using telegram

I have created a telegram bot using python.
This bot can perform basic operations - add, subtract, multiply and divide


Note:
As of now the user does not get any response for a command that is wrong or in the wrong format.
Only the developer recieves error messages as logs in the active terminal of the running python code.
